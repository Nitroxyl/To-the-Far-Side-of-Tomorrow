# Santara custom content catalogue

This branch adds an **opt-in GM-only Firestore importer** to the Trainer Pokémon screen. It does not automatically populate Firestore when the page loads, edit assigned Pokémon, or grant gimmick unlocks.

## Using the importer

1. Merge/deploy the GM branch and hard-refresh the GM Trainer Pokémon page.
2. Sign in using the campaign GM Firebase account.
3. Open **Trainer Pokémon → + Import Santara Content**.
4. Choose one group and press **Import missing**. Review the spoiler warning.
5. The site checks live Firestore documents by their slug and creates only missing records in a batch. Existing definitions, uploaded artwork, and modified stats remain untouched.
6. To use an imported Mega, manually assign it to a compatible existing Pokémon in its GM editor. Existing Pokémon records never change automatically.

The importer uses existing Firestore collections: santara_species_overrides, santara_custom_abilities, santara_custom_moves, and santara_mega_forms.

## Content groups

| Group | Included | Who can read it after import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original fossils | 4 original species, Apex Predator, Tar Rend, Riptide Bite, Faultline Gore | Approved Trainers |
| Reworked Mega Evolutions | 17 Mega forms, 7 custom abilities, 4 Mega signature moves | Mega forms: GM only; associated move and ability definitions: approved Trainers |
| Story and alternate forms | Rotom-Server, Yveltal Eclipse Forme, Root Access | Approved Trainers |
| Provisional signature moves | Glitch Pulse, Nihil Light (clearly marked as working drafts) | Approved Trainers |

**Spoilers:** Do not import unrevealed story content early. The repository itself is public, so the source code can also be viewed outside Firestore.

## Ability and move details

The full descriptions are stored in santara-catalog.js and appear in battle sheets after import.

- Apex Predator: physical attacks +30% versus injured targets; heal 25% of max HP on knockout.
- Kingdom's End: five rounds of Calamitous Sun; Fire ×1.5, Water fails, Fire resistances neutralized; ends on switching.
- Bastion Furnace: prevents Defense and Sp. Defense reductions; above half HP reduces super-effective damage 25%; at or below half boosts Fire and Psychic damage 30%.
- Tempest Crown: Royal Tempest for five rounds, Electric +30%, Thunder and Hurricane cannot miss.
- Aurora Chorus: establishes Aurora Veil without needing snow.
- Molten Edge: Fire and slicing damage +30%, but does not double-stack.
- System Override: inflicts Exposed (Ability suppression, Speed reduction, boosted Normal/Electric damage). The 20% damage modifier and expiry mechanics are working design proposals.
- Root Access: combines Levitate and Prankster.
- Siege Battery (new proposal): Electro Shot skips charging; first damaging hit each round gives +1 SpA.
- Tar Rend: 85 BP Poison Physical, guaranteed Defense −1 on hit.
- Riptide Bite: 85 BP Water Physical biting move, 30% Defense −1.
- Faultline Gore: 100 BP Ground Physical, recoil 25% of damage dealt.
- Psycannon: 120 BP Psychic Special, user Speed −1.
- Infernal Sweep: 95 BP Fire Special spread move.
- Schradebreaker: 130 BP Fire Special, 90 accuracy, destroys screens.
- Schrade's End: 180 BP Fire Special cone, one round to charge, once per battle.

**Superseded drafts:** Charizard Z's most recent revision has **200 SpA**, not the earlier 159 or 199. Ceruledge uses **Sharpness** instead of Soulrend; Greninja uses **Technician**.

**Not previously finalized:** Mega Archaludon's spread and Siege Battery are newly authored proposals. Glitch Pulse and Nihil Light remain optional and separate because their descriptions were not finalized.

## Limitations

- This is a tracker; custom ability and move effects are readable descriptions, not automated turn/damage rules.
- Imported Mega definitions need to be manually assigned to Pokémon already owned by Trainers.
- GitHub cannot inspect live Firestore user data. The importer checks that data only after the authenticated GM clicks Import.
- The current Firestore collection rules already cover these document shapes; there is no additional rules file to deploy for this change.
